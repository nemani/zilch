# zilch

A new zsh theme based heavily on agnoster, but customized for nemani.

## Improvements over agnoster (working-list)

- PWD truncation

- Username truncation

- Uniform implementation (based on ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh & agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme)

- Agnoster theme was showing git repos with yellow (dirty) background even on clean repo, fixed in this commit

- Web3 Additions (show block number, show current gas estimate, etc)
